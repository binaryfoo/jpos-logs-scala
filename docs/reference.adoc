== Filters

Use these with the filters: -f and --field.

[cols="2*", options="header"]
|===
|Example
|Description

|mti=0200
|Field 0 (MTI) is 0200

|rtt>500
|Round trip time (available with --pair) is greater than or equal to 500ms

|11<123456
|STAN is less than or equal to 123456

|48~magic
|Field 48 contains magic (case sensitive)
|===

== Field Expressions

Use these with the table output formats: --ascii, --csv, --tsv --utf, --html and the live variants (--live-html, --live-ascii, --live-utf).

=== jPOS

=== log4j

In a log record like `[08 Nov 2014 13:54:59,001] INFO  [a.ClassName]: Did something useful` the following fields are available.

[cols="2*", options="header"]
|===
|Name
|Value in example

|timestamp
|2014-11-08 13:54:59.001

|level
|INFO

|category
|a.ClassName

|message
|Did something useful

|===

If the log4j record contains a jPOS message, like the following example, all the usual jPOS fields are available.
If there is a name collision, the value from the jPOS entry is available with the prefix `jpos.`. For example `timestamp` and `jpos.timestamp` in the following example.

    [08 Nov 2014 01:00:20,529] ERROR [some.package]: <log realm="some.channel/172.0.1.7:4779" at="Sat Nov 08 01:00:21 EST 2014.001" lifespan="290ms">
        <receive>
          <exception name="Oops">
          Oops
          </exception>
        </receive>
      </log>

== Output Formats

By default the same text that's input: just act as a filter not an aggregator or formatter.

[cols="3*", options="header"]
|===
| Flag
| Example
| Format

| --csv
| --csv mti,nmic,count
| Comma separated field values

| --tsv
| --tsv mti,nmic,count
| Tab separated field values

| --html
| --html time,summary,src
| HTML table

| --ascii
| --ascii exception,count
| ASCII 'art' table. Like mysql client.

| --utf
| --utf time,summary,src
| Same as --ascii but uses characters that might not print on your terminal.

| --jira-table
| --jira-table exception,count
| Table that can be pasted into jira
|===

There are also --live-html, --live-utf and --live-html versions that spit out the results incrementally (as they are discovered) rather than waiting until all field widths are known.
